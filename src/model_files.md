<h1>Source Model Files</h1>

Because the source model files are too big to be uploaded on GitHub I have upladed them onto my Google Drive. You can download them here:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qF_MQSNcU5yGpOySzq0dizCZh0FT_QO-?usp=sharing

In there you will find 2 files:
    <li>Interior</li> 
    <li>Exterior</li>
    
I guess they are self explaining. Feel free to add more parts to it and correct mesh issues here and there (I think there might be some).
